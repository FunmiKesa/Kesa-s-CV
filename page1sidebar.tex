% \cvsection{Projects}
% \cvproject{Masked Face Detection for ATM}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Developed a head classifier to detect masked faces in ATM to potentially prevent the event of robbery.
% \item Different camera angle, position, image quality, illumination and type of occlusion were the major challenges. Improved the existing accuracy by 20\%.
% \end{itemize}
% \smallskip
% \cvproject{Person Tracking}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Developed, modified and implemented robust object tracker by combining motion and appearance information to learn deep association metrics.
% \end{itemize}
% \smallskip
% \cvproject{One Shot Learning}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item One shot learning is the promising approach to learn good feature when little data is available. 
% \item Achieved 92\% accuracy on omniglot dataset using Siamese network with Bayesian optimization.
% \end{itemize}
% \smallskip
% \cvproject{Automatic Defect Inspection of solar farm using drones}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Regular inspection of solar farm due to its wide size is strenuous. 
% \item Developed a model to classify and localize defect on thermal images captured by drones.
% \end{itemize}
% \smallskip
% \cvproject{Anomaly detection using Auto-Encoders}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Developed a model to learn regular patterns from sensor data and detect unusual pattern.
% \end{itemize}
% \smallskip
% \cvproject{Early Warning Fault Detection and Identification}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Developed an LSTM based model to forecast and detect outlier from sensor data. 
% \item Further, classified the given signal into one of the type of outlier.
% \end{itemize}
% \smallskip
% \cvproject{Sentiment Analysis}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Used bag-of-words, pre-trained Embedding and simple as well as bi-directional LSTM techniques for Sentiment Analysis.
% \end{itemize}
